# Hi! I'm Travis. :wave:

I'm a solution-oriented IT leader who values efficiency, security, and collaboration. I am currently working in the IAM space to secure company data and streamline user experiences.

This website and [my resume](https://resume.tbaraki.net) are both built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). They deploy to Azure as Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions.
