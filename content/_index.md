# Hi! I'm Travis. :wave:

I'm a solution-oriented IT leader who values efficiency, security, and collaboration.

My recent focus has been on migrating to, and effectively leveraging, AzureAD, Intune, and Autopilot to empower remote teams. I'm currently looking for a new role in this space; please [reach out](mailto:travis@tbaraki.net) if your organization is looking to add a committed SysAdmin to its ranks.

This website and [my resume](https://resume.tbaraki.net) are both built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). They deploy to Azure Static Web Apps from GitHub.
