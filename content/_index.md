# Hi! I'm Travis. :wave:

I'm an experienced Security Engineer with a focus on Identity and Access Management (IAM). My goal is to mitigate identity risk while supporting business processes, implementing infrastrucure-as-code solutions where possible. I love thinking about strong authentication, RBAC/ABAC, and lifecycle management.

This website and [my resume](https://resume.tbaraki.net) are both built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). They deploy to Azure as Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions.
